## Power of a Growth Mindset

This webpage I made shows what I believe is necessary in a growth mindset and how I am constantly keeping myself in that mindset. 

## About Me

Along with that, this webpage also describes a bit about **myself** and what I expect to do in the future. It even shows what I learned with coding throughout my years in school and learning it through other methods, such as [GitHub](https://github.com) and [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). 

I could even go through the different programming languages I have learned throughout my life. 

+ Python
+ Java
+ Javascript
+ C

As of now, there are a few major things I need to complete in order to feel fulfilled in life.
- [x] Create an idea of a CS Project that I can be satisfied with.
- [ ] Graduate university and get my degree in CS.
- [ ] Get a good job that I will be happy with once I finish uni.

> When you visit my webpage, please read through it to see if there is anything for you to take away from what I think is important to keeping a growth mindset.

![With all of this in mind, I hope you enjoy reading what I put down in my web page on having a growth mindset.](https://images.pexels.com/photos/108941/pexels-photo-108941.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1200)
