  <h2>3 Things Important in a Growth Mindset</h2>
    <body>To start, one thing that I like to keep in mind about my life is that there will always be something unexpected that may throw a wrench in any plans that you have, and that's to be expected. The important thing is to never let these kinds of accidents get to you and keep a cool hear as you work on any challenges that you may face in the future.</body>
    <body>Another thing I like to think about is to always keep preserving in anything I set out to do, because I believe that it will all be worth it in the end once I succeed in finishing a difficult task.</body>
    <body>One final thing that I think about when having a growth mindset is knowing why I am setting out to accomplish a difficult task. Knwoing that this will benefit not only me, but my family as well is a good motivator for me to keep studying and aiming for my degree.</body>
